===

To install the Shortcut app you must first get an API Token. To do this, login to Shortcut and head over to 
the "Settings" page.

Next, enter a name for your new API Token. This can be anything you like, in this example we've named 
it "Deskpro Shortcut App".

Click "Generate Token" and you'll be presented with your new API token. Copy the API key for a later step. 
It's **important that you keep your secret API token safe**.

Ok, now it's time to head back to Deskpro. Click on the "Settings" tab and enter the API token we created in the 
previous steps.

To configure who can see and use the Shortcut app, head to the "Permissions" tab and select those users and/or groups you'd like to have access.

When you're happy, click "Install".
