Basic Usage
---

We recommend using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to manage this project. First, start by installing the project 
dependencies from inside the project directory `app-template-vite`.

```bash
yarn install
```

Then, run the development server.

```bash
yarn start
```

You should now be able to view the bare-bones app in your browser.

For more information or to start developing an app, please take a look at our [developer guides](https://support.deskpro.com/en/guides/developers/apps/apps-1/anatomy-of-an-app).

Testing
---

We've included `jest` to run your tests. It will look anywhere in `/src` for test suite files ending in `.test.tsx`.

You can run all tests using:

```bash
yarn test
```
